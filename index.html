      a croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains
      dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants
      belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with
      brioche, Danish and puff pastries.

    <h2>So, what's the history?</h2>
    <p>
      Legends say the croissant was invented as a special roll in Vienna to
      celebrate the end of its invasion by Turkish troops from the Ottoman
      Empire in 1683.
